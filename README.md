# evolutionary_algorithm made by Lukas Staehelin

1. Step
   Create evolutionary algorithm with fixed size neural network architechures.

2. Step
   Train & compare algorithm against already exisiting approaches

3. Improve evoltionary algorithm, e.g. include architechural mutations/crossovers NEAT-style.
